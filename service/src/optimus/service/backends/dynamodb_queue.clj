;; This is a implementation of a durable queueing system based on DynamoDB.
;; The `DurableQueue` protocol was designed to support asynchronous tasks.
;; The assumption is the queue is a place where to put tasks which will be
;; completed in the background while the API return control to the user.
;; For the nature of the target use case these are the basic assumptions
;; and characteritics which are required to be supported:
;;
;;   * FIFO (but not strictly)
;;   * Low volume - maybe 10-20 items per week
;;   * Concurrent - should support access by multiple nodes
;;   * Track completed tasks for operational reference.
;;
;; We want to use DynamoDB because it is the primary storage for the
;; rest of the system and we didn't want to introduce a additional
;; service like SQS or Kinesis for such low usage.  Should assumptions
;; change, it might be required to review this implementation or
;; provide alternative implementation.
;;

;;
;; # The Dynamo table
;;
;; The following list shows each protocol function along with the
;; access pattern:
;;
;;    - send-message!         -> n/a
;;    - reserve-next-message! -> topic, status, timestamp and lease
;;    - acknowledge-message!  -> id
;;    - extend-message-lease! -> id
;;    - list-messages!        -> topic, status, timestamp (opt: lease, pid)
;;
;; We have selected `id` to be our partition key, for optimal and
;; uniform spread, and easy access. While `reserve-next-message!`
;; requires the `topic`, a `timestamp` ordered sequence of
;; items/messages and the current `status` to determine whether an
;; item is new, already reserved or acknowledged.  In order to support
;; a efficient search/selection of the item to process we use a
;; global-secondary-index in dynamo with `topic` as partition key, and
;; a synthetic (compound) key as sort key. The synthetic key is called
;; `__reserv_key` and it is composed of:
;;
;;    - N flag: 0/1 whether the item is new.
;;    - R flag: 0/1 whether the item has been reserved.
;;    - A flag: 0/1 whether the item has been acknowledged.
;;    - timestamp: the zero-padded `timestamp` of the issue, for ordering
;;
;; The first three flags are mutually exclusive, so only one
;; can be set at any point in time.
;; Here a sample representation of the `reservation-index`.
;;
;;     vvv<     20 digits      >
;;     NRA      timestamp
;;     0010000000001484675535808       - acknowledged item
;;     0010000000001484675535809       - acknowledged item
;;     0010000000001484675535810       - acknowledged item
;;     0100000000001484675535811       - reserved item
;;     1000000000001484675535812       - new item
;;     1000000000001484675743590       - new item
;;     1000000000001484675743593       - new item
;;
;;
;; Now it is easy to see how we can efficiently slice the list of
;; items to process. If we want to fine the next item to reserve we
;; can look into the reserved items (for expired leases) and new items
;; skipping all the acknowledged items by filtering the prefix for
;; things which start with `010` or `100`.
;;
;; One thing to keep in mind is that reserved items could bear an
;; expired lease and therefore be open to reservation again.
;; So the query must check the individual item's `:lease`.
;;
;;
;; ## Concurrency
;;
;; Since DynamoDB doesn't support transactions, all updates are
;; performed using Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) techniques
;; and Dynamo's conditional update features.
;;
;; Every item contains a synthetic attribute called `__ver` which is
;; monotonically incremented on every write. Every write, optimistically
;; reads a previous version from the storage, computes a modification
;; and attempts to write it back checking that the current value of
;; `__ver` in the datastore hasn't changed in the meanwhile.
;; If the value is the same the new write is performed (with a new `__ver`)
;; and the transaction is successful. If the value was changed by another
;; concurrent write, then the test fail and the write is aborted.
;; The function which handle all the writes and ensures this logic is preserved
;; is `safe-put-item`. It includes also a special case for the first write
;; which ensures that no other object with the same `id` is already existing.
;;
;; END

;; `find-next-processable-items` queries the reservation-index for

;; index.  From that point it starts scanning the index and filter the
;; items until it finds a item which is new or expired.  The scanning
;; has a cost and we do scan only for the first 10 elements.
;; The consequence is that if a new item is in position 11 it will be
;; ignored until one of the first 10 is acknowledged or the lease expires.
;; This limitation isn't so bad as we do expect to have very low volumes,
;; and because of the expiration the system will eventually move on.
;; Another positive effect of this behaviour is that in case of exceptions
;; during the processing only the first 10 elements would be tried.
;; if all of them ran into exceptions, they will appear reserved
;; and blocked for the duration of the lease-time and eventually expired
;; and retried. Without this behaviour if the processing raises
;; and exception and there are 100s of items waiting in the queue,
;; all of them would be reserved.
